 /**
  * A skewed associative randomized indexing policy.
  * @sa  \ref gem5MemorySystem "gem5 Memory System"
  *
  * The skewed indexing policy has a variable mapping based on a hash function,
  * so a value x can be mapped to different sets, based on the way being used.
  *
  * For example, let's assume address A maps to set 3 on way 0. It will likely
  * have a different set for every other way. Visually, the possible locations
  * of A are, for a table with 4 ways and 8 sets (arbitrarily chosen sets; these
  * locations depend on A and the hashing function used):
  *    Way 0   1   2   3
  *  Set   _   _   _   _
  *    0  |_| |_| |X| |_|
  *    1  |_| |_| |_| |X|
  *    2  |_| |_| |_| |_|
  *    3  |X| |_| |_| |_|
  *    4  |_| |_| |_| |_|
  *    5  |_| |X| |_| |_|
  *    6  |_| |_| |_| |_|
  *    7  |_| |_| |_| |_|
  *
  * Only supports ways that are multiples of number of skew-functions. 
  * So ways/skew is a whole number >=1
  * 
  * Requires full tags to support regeneration of address from a 
  * one-way hash function (like Scatter-Cache) used for skewed-indexing.
