## Goal of the Project
- Design a hybrid cache architecture that:
  1. Combines MIRAGE's global eviction to prevent conï¬‚ict-based attacks.
  2. Integrates GhostMinion's strictness-order to prevent transient execution attacks.
  3. Evaluates the performance overhead of these combined techniques.
- **Metrics of interest:** IPC, MPKI

## Plan for Checkpoint-I
1. Set up the Gem5 simulator and run the SpecCPU benchmark.
2. Adapt the GhostMinion codebase (originally for ARM architecture) to x86 architecture.
3. Evaluate the performance overhead of GhostMinion individually.
4. Adapt the MIRAGE codebase (originally written for Gem5 v19.0) to the latest Gem5 version.
5. Evaluate the performance overhead of MIRAGE individually.

## Plan for Checkpoint-II
1. Integrate MIRAGE and GhostMinion into a single codebase.
2. Implement possible optimizations.
3. Evaluate the performance overhead of the combined techniques.


## Configurations
- Ubuntu 24.10 :  we used. It can be lesser ubuntu version as well
- *{BASE}* : **Workspace/**
- *{BASE}/../resources_gem5* : Contains **cpu2017-*.iso**
- *{BASE}/SPEC17_workloads*: Contains built and installed benchmark suits.
- *{BASE}/myScripts* : Contains all the custom wrirtten scripts.
- *{BASE}/mygem5* : Contains modified gem5 code as part of various techniques' implementation.
- 

## Steps to follow
1. Git clone: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sammagnet7/cs773_CompArch-Perf-Security
```
2. Copy paste the **cpu2017-*.iso** file into folder *Final_Project/resources_gem5*. Then go to **{BASE}**
3. 
```bash
cd Final_Project/Workspace 

export BASE=$(pwd)
```
3. To install software package dependencies, run from **{BASE}**
```bash
./myScripts/dependencies.sh
```
4. To build gem5 with x86 architecture, from **{BASE}*: install scons by `pip install SCons`
```bash
cd mygem5

N=$(grep ^cpu\\scores /proc/cpuinfo | uniq |  awk '{print $4}')

scons build/X86/gem5.opt -j${N}

cd $BASE
```
5. For installing SpecCpu benchmarks: 
   - Follow the instructions mentioned in the script `myScripts/build_iso/build_spec17_x86.sh`
  
6. To run all the benchmarks and get and comparative stats: 
```bash
./run_spec/run_spec17.sh [num_instructions] [num_warmup_instructions] <gem5_source_folder> <flavour>
eg. ./run_spec/run_spec17.sh 10000000000 5000000 mygem5_v20.1.0.0_Ghost_Mirage_ARM merged
```
  - All the variables are defined in `myScripts/vars.sh`. Modify the values as required.
  - To check the progress, run `./myScripts/run_spec/run_utils.sh -w <SESSION>`. This `SESSION` value will be presetnt in run_spec17.sh output.
>Note: Find the stats files created inside **$BASE/SPEC17_workloads/benchspec/CPU/{becnhmark_folder: r for freq and s for speed}/run/{*base*}.mm64.0000/flavour_session**

7. To plot graphs:
```bash
cd $BASE

./myScripts/run_plot/plot_spec17.sh
```
> Note: Find the generated plots inside: **$BASE/myScripts/run_plot/plots**


## Scripts Overview [`myScripts/`]

1. **`dependencies.sh`**  
  - Installs all necessary software dependencies for the project.  
  - Must be executed from the `BASE` directory.

2. **`build_iso/build_spec17_x86.sh`**  
  - Automates the setup and installation of the SpecCPU 2017 benchmark suite.  
  - Mounts the `cpu2017-*.iso` file, installs the benchmarks, and configures the environment.

3. **`vars.sh`**  
  - Contains global variables used throughout the project.  
  - Includes paths, benchmark configurations, gem5 architecture, flavour settings, and runtime parameters like `GEM5_SRC_DIR`, `GEM5_ARCH`, and `PLOTS_DIR`.

4. **`run_spec/run_spec17.sh`**  
  - Executes SpecCPU benchmarks with configurable parameters such as instruction count, warmup instructions, gem5 source folder, and flavour.  
  - Outputs benchmark statistics to designated directories.

5. **`run_spec/run_utils.sh`**  
  - Provides tools to monitor benchmark execution progress.  
  - Requires a `SESSION` identifier from the output of `run_spec17.sh`.

6. **`run_plot/plot_spec17.sh`**  
  - Generates visual plots from benchmark results.  
  - Saves the plots in the `myScripts/run_plot/plots` directory.

7. **`run_gem5/run_gem5.sh`**  
  - Executes the `gem5` binary with specified parameters and arguments.  
  - Modifications to this script apply to all flavour versions.

8. **`run_gem5/run_{mirage,vanilla,ghostminion}.sh`**  
  - Specialized scripts for running `gem5` with flavour-specific configurations.  
  - Changes to these scripts affect only the respective flavour.
