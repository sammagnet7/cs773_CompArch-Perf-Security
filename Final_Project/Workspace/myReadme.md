## Goal of the Project
- Design a hybrid cache architecture that:
  1. Combines MIRAGE's global eviction to prevent conï¬‚ict-based attacks.
  2. Integrates GhostMinion's strictness-order to prevent transient execution attacks.
  3. Evaluates the performance overhead of these combined techniques.
- **Metrics of interest:** IPC, MPKI

## Plan for Checkpoint-I
1. Set up the Gem5 simulator and run the SpecCPU benchmark.
2. Adapt the GhostMinion codebase (originally for ARM architecture) to x86 architecture.
3. Evaluate the performance overhead of GhostMinion individually.
4. Adapt the MIRAGE codebase (originally written for Gem5 v19.0) to the latest Gem5 version.
5. Evaluate the performance overhead of MIRAGE individually.

## Plan for Checkpoint-II
1. Integrate MIRAGE and GhostMinion into a single codebase.
2. Implement possible optimizations.
3. Evaluate the performance overhead of the combined techniques.


## Configurations
- Workspace/ : BaseDir
- {BaseDir}/../resources_gem5 : Put the `cpu2017-*.iso`
- {BaseDir}/SPEC17_workloads: Contains the built and installed benchmark suits.
- {BaseDir}/myScripts : Contains all the custom wrirtten scripts.
- {BaseDir}/mygem5 : Contains modified gem5 code as part of various techniques' implementation.

## Steps to follow
1. For installing SpecCpu benchmarks:
   - Follow the instructions mentioned in the script `{BaseDir}/myScripts/build_spec17_x86.sh`
2.
